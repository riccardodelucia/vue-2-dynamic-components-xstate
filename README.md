# Vue 2 Dynamic GUI with XState

This project is used to test how to manage the component rendering through a state machine, implemented with the **XState** library. 
The state machine is controlled by component's buttons, which send events to the machine, thus evolving the state. The state, in turns, is used to understand which component to render.
